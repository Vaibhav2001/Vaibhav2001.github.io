title: The Coin Change Problem
---

### Question

There is a cashier who has been instructed by his superiors that whenever a customer has to be given a change it should be given in the <b>least number of coins possible</b>. 
<br>
<br>
As the cashier is not an expert of coding he requires you to create a program for him that will do this job for him and tell him what is the <b>least number of coins</b> that he can give as change.
<br>
<br>
You are given <b>N <em>(the number of different denominations of coins)</em>, C <em>(the change to be given)</em></b> and N different integers which tell the <b>denominations</b>. It can assumed that there is no such condition where the exact amount of chnage can't be returned.

### Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">
This is one of the classic questions that require <b>DP (Dynamic Prgramming)</b>, so I thought that it is important to discuss it. This question is a very popular one and is genrally one of the first questions of DP that many people encounter. It is a perfect example to demonstrate the <b>power of DP</b>.

### Approaching The Solution

_**I highly recommend you to try to find your own approach before reading mine**_

<div style="text-align: justify">
The first thing you should do is keep the <b>computer aside</b> and take out your <b>pen and a piece of paper</b>. Because many of us will be tempted to make an if-else construct to solve this question if we are not aware of DP. If you <b>make some examples</b> and try solving some questions you might get some idea of what the question requires you to do. 
<br>
<br>
After doing that you might something interesting. That the answer is not at all based on a greedy approach. For example if you have coins of <b>denominations <em>30, 7 and 1</em></b> and you have to return a change of 35. What our <b>basic instinct would suggest is to give a coin of 30 </b>to start it off. However, later we will have to give <b>5 coins of denomination 1</b>, which would make the total count <b>6</b>. Instead, if we use only coins of <b>denomination 7</b> then we can achieve the task in only <b>5 coins</b>, which is the best we can do in the given example.

If you need help with the code then here is mine-

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    //input
    int s, n;
    cin >> s >> n;
    int a[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> a[i];
    }
    int m[s+1];

    //intialise to max 
    for(int i = 0; i < s+1; i++)
    {
        m[i] = numeric_limits<int>::max();
    }

    //Dyamic Programming
    m[0] = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= s; i++)
    {
        for(int j = 0;j < n; j++)
        {
            if(a[j] <= i )
            {
                if(m[i-a[j]]+1 < m[i] && m[i-a[j]] != INT_MAX)
                {
                    m[i] = m[i-a[j]]+1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << m[s];
    return 0;
}
```
