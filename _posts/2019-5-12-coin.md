title: The Coin Change Problem
---

### Question

There is a cashier who has been instructed by his superiors that whenever a customer has to be given a change it should be given in the least number of coins possible. 
As the cashier is not an expert of coding he requires you to create a program for him that will do this job for him and tell him what is the least number of coins that he can give as change.
You are given N (the number of different denominations of coins) and N different integers which tell the denominations.

If you need help with the code then here is mine-

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;
ll n, k;
ll M = -123456789876;

int main()
{
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cout.tie(NULL);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    cin >> n >> k;
    map<ll, ll> m[n];
    vector<ll> a[n];
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        ll x;
        cin >> x;
        for(int j = 0; j < x; j++)
        {   
            ll y;
            cin >> y;
            a[i].push_back(y);
            m[i][y] = M;
        }
    }
    bool visited[n];
    memset(visited, false, sizeof(visited));
    queue<ll> q;
    q.push(0);
    ll count = 1;
    visited[0] = true;
    while(!q.empty())
    {
        ll src = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for(int  i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(!visited[i])
            {
                ll c = 0;
                for(auto it = a[src].begin(); it != a[src].end(); it++)
                {
                    if(m[i].find(*it) != m[i].end())
                    {
                        c++;
                        if(c == k)
                        {
                            // cout << i << " ";
                            q.push(i);
                            visited[i] = true;
                            count++;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    cout << count << endl;
}
```
