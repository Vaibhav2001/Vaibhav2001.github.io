title: Shortest Paths In Graphs
---

<div style="text-justify">
Computing <em><b>shortest path in graphs</b></em> is an essential concept. When you encounter problems in some coding competition it will generally be a combination of <b>shortest paths and traversal</b>. There <b>three</b> algorithms that are <em><b>essential</b></em> to learn to compute shortest paths: <em><b>Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman Ford Algorithm and Floyd Warshall Algorithm</b></em>.

### Dijkstra's Algoritm

<div style="text-justify">
This algorithm is named after a dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra. This algorithm provides us with an efficient way to compute the shortest path in a graph with <b>NON NEGATIVE</b> edges. It is an interesting concept and i svery useful to solve <em><b>real life problems</b></em>. Even some <b>map apps</b> that we use these days rely on it. Let's look at an example.
