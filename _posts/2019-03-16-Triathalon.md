### Overview

This question came in INOI in the year 2012 and was a basic question with a simple twist. Any experienced programmer could just take one look at this and get to the solution immediately. However, when I first saw this question(starting as a beginner in competetive coding) the solution didn't come to mind so easily. So, if you are beginner or even if you have a bit of an experience with coding and you dont get the solution after putting in your brains, chill. One important thing that you will, however, learn from this question is how to use your mind to think systematically.

### Understanding The Question

So the question tells us that there is some competition taking place in some town and the manager of the town want the competition to end as soon as possible. There are three parts to the competition: COBOL, pole vault, and donut-eating. We are told that only person at a time can participate in COBOL(which is the first event). We already know beforehand the time required by each participant in each event. That is all there is in the question and now we need to find a way to solve it.
