<div style="text-align: justify" id = "Bellman">
This is an algorithm which is based on <b>Dynamic Programming</b>. The reason why we use it over Dijkstra is that it can deal with even those graphs which have <em><b>negative edge weights but not a negative cycle</b></em>. It is an <b>efficient algorithm</b> and is useful when dealing with certain types of problems.
