<div style="text-align: justify">
Dyanmic Programming, popularly abbreviated as DP, is a very <b>interesting and essential</b> part of competetive programming. In dynamic programming what we do is store the results and then <em><b>reuse</b></em> these results to reach the final answer ultimately. Let's look at an example.

![Grid Path](/images/grid.png "Grid Path")

<div style="text-align: justify">
Let's take a look at this grid. This is a standard problem in <b>DP</b>. Suppose we have to go from the <b>top left corner</b> to the <b>bottom right corner</b> given that you can either move <b>down or right</b>. Now you have to tell that in how many ways can you do this. So we will use a <b>dynamic approach</b> to solve this problem. So first let's find the number of ways that we can reach the blocks in the first row and the first column. Well that's pretty simple as you are allowed to move either <b>down or right</b> so the number of ways will be 1.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
  Now if we move on to the next row we can now use our <b>dynamic approach</b> moving right. To reach any block the last block in that path will be the one before it or the above it as we are allowed only to move <b>right or down</b>. So for any block the number of paths to reach that block will be the <b>sum of the number</b> of paths above it and left to it. So finally our grid will look something like this.

  This might have given you a basic but a clear idea about <em><b>Dynamic Programming</b></em>. If you wat to look at the code for this problem then it is given below.
  </div>

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;
	int a[n][m];
	//initializing the number of paths
	for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		a[i][0] = 1;
	}
	for(int j = 0; j < m; j++)
	{
		a[0][j] = 1;
	}
	//using our dynamic approach
	for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
	{
		for(int j = 1; j < m; j++)
		{
			a[i][j] = a[i-1][j] + a[i][j-1];
		}
	}
	//priting the answer
	cout << a[n-1][m-1] << endl;
}
```
