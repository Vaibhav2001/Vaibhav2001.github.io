title: Dynamic Programming

<div style="text-align: justify">
Dyanmic Programming is a very <b>interesting and essential</b> part of competetive programming. In dynamic programming what we do is store the results and then <em><b>reuse</b></em> these results to reach the final answer ultimately. Let's look at an example.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Let's take a look at this grid. This is a standard problem in <b>DP</b>. Suppose we have to go from the <b>top left corner</b> to the <b>bottom right corner</b> given that you can either move <b>down or right</b>. Now you have to tell that in how many ways can you do this. So we will use a <b>dynamic approach</b> to solve this problem. So first let's find the number of ways that we can reach the blocks in the first row and the first column. Well that's pretty simple as you are allowed to move either <b>down or right</b> so the number of ways will be 1.
